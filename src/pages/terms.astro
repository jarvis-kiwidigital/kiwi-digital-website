        <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("Client," "you," or "your")

          by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use our services.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Services</h2>

        <p>
          Specific Services are defined in individual project agreements, statements of work (SOW), or proposals, 
          which take precedence over these general Terms in case of conflict.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Engagement and Scope</h2>
        
        <h3>3.1 Project Agreements</h3>
        <p>
          Each project will be governed by a separate agreement, proposal, or SOW that outlines the scope, deliverables, 
          timeline, and pricing. These project-specific documents are incorporated into and form part of these Terms.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Scope Changes</h3>
        <p>
          Any changes to the agreed scope of work must be documented in writing and mutually agreed upon by both parties. 
          Changes may result in adjustments to timeline and pricing.
        </p>

        <h3>3.3 Client Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>The Client agrees to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide timely access to necessary information, systems, and personnel</li>
          <li>Respond to requests for feedback and approvals within agreed timeframes</li>
          <li>Ensure that any content, data, or materials provided to us do not infringe third-party rights</li>
          <li>Maintain necessary licenses for third-party software and services</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Fees and Payment</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Pricing</h3>
        <p>
          Fees for Services are outlined in the applicable project agreement or proposal. Unless otherwise specified, 
          all fees are quoted in New Zealand Dollars (NZD) and exclude GST, which will be added where applicable.
        </p>

        <h3>4.2 Payment Terms</h3>
        <p>
          Payment terms vary by project but typically include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Deposit:</strong> 50% upfront deposit before work commences</li>
          <li><strong>Milestone Payments:</strong> Staged payments upon completion of agreed milestones</li>
          <li><strong>Final Payment:</strong> Balance due upon project completion or delivery</li>
          <li><strong>Recurring Services:</strong> Monthly invoicing for ongoing support and maintenance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Invoices are due within 7 days of issue unless otherwise specified. Late payments may incur interest at 
          a rate of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower.
        </p>

        <h3>4.3 Third-Party Costs</h3>
        <p>
          Unless included in the project agreement, third-party costs (e.g., hosting, domain registration, API fees, 
          software licenses) are the Client's responsibility and will be billed separately or reimbursed.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Client-Owned IP</h3>
        <p>
          Upon full payment of all fees, ownership of custom-developed software, code, and deliverables specific to 
          your project ("Client IP") will transfer to you, unless otherwise specified in the project agreement.
        </p>
