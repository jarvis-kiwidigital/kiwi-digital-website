    q: 'How much does custom software cost?',
    a: "It depends on what you need, but most projects range from $5K–$50K NZD. Small automations can be a few thousand. Full custom systems with integrations are more. We'll give you a clear, fixed-price quote after the discovery phase — no surprises, no hidden fees.",
  },
  {
    q: 'How long does a project take?',
    a: "Simple automations can be done in 1-2 weeks. Full custom software typically takes 2-4 months from start to finish. We work in sprints, so you'll see progress every week — not a big reveal at the end. You'll be using parts of the system while we're still building other parts.",
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you work with businesses outside NZ?',
    a: "Absolutely. We're based in Hawke's Bay, but we've worked with clients across Australia, the UK, USA, and beyond. All our tools and processes are built for remote collaboration. If you're in a wildly different timezone, we'll work out a schedule that suits both of us.",
  },
  {
    q: 'What if I already use Xero/Podio/other tools?',
    a: "Perfect — we integrate with them. We're a Xero Gold Partner and certified Podio implementer, and we've built integrations with dozens of other platforms (Gmail, Outlook, Slack, QuickBooks, you name it). We'll connect your existing tools instead of replacing them.",
  },
  {
    q: 'What happens after the software is built?',
    a: "We don't disappear. Every project includes documentation, training, and a handover period. After that, most clients stay on a support retainer — if something breaks, needs tweaking, or you want to add features, we're a Slack message away. You're not locked in, but most clients stick around.",
  },
  {
    q: "I'm not tech-savvy — will I understand the system?",
    a: "That's the whole point. We build for business owners, not developers. The systems we create are simple to use — if you can use email and a web browser, you can use what we build. We'll train your team and make sure everyone's comfortable before we hand it over.",
  },
