  {
    q: 'How much does a typical project cost?',
    a: "It depends on scope, but most of our projects range from $5K–$50K NZD. We'll give you a clear quote after the discovery phase — no surprises. We also offer ongoing retainer arrangements for continuous development and support.",
  },
  {
    q: "We're not a tech company. Can you still help us?",
    a: "Absolutely — that's our specialty. Most of our clients are in agriculture, construction, hospitality, and trades. We translate business problems into technology solutions. You don't need to know how it works — just what you need it to do.",
  },
  {
    q: 'What does "AI integration" actually mean for my business?',
    a: "It means using AI to do things your team currently does manually — processing emails, classifying documents, generating reports, answering customer queries, analysing data. We build these into your existing tools so it feels natural, not like learning a new system.",
  },
  {
    q: 'How long does a project typically take?',
    a: "MVPs in 4-6 weeks. Full production applications in 2-4 months. We ship iteratively, so you see working software from week one — not a big reveal at the end. AI-assisted development means we move significantly faster than traditional agencies.",
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you work with international clients?',
    a: "Absolutely. We're headquartered in Hawke's Bay, New Zealand, but we work with businesses globally. Our tools and processes are built for remote collaboration, and we've delivered projects across multiple time zones and continents.",
  },
  {
    q: 'What happens after launch?',
    a: "We don't disappear. Every project includes a handover period, documentation, and training. We offer ongoing support and development retainers for clients who want continuous improvement. Most of our clients stick around.",
  },
